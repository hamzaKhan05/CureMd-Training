 READ Num;
 if (Num < 10) AND (Num == 7)

6) Write a program that asks a user for number and prints the multiplication table of that number up to 10. 
PROGRAM TableOfNum:
 Read Num;
 counter = 1;
 TableNo;
 while (counter <= 10)
  Do TableNo = Num * counter;
  Print TableNo; //prints the Table of Num 10 times.

END

7) Write a program that computes factorial of a number (n!). 
PROGRAM Factorial:
 Read Num;
 FactorialOfNum;
 Counter = 1;
 if (Num == 1) OR (Num == 0) // as factorial of 0 and 1 both are 1.
  Print "Factorial of " Num " is 1";
 else 
  for (Counter = 1; Counter <= Num) // loop terminates after we multiply factorial with all the numbers including the Number itself
   FactorialOfNum = FactorialOfNum * Counter;
   Counter = Counter + 1;
   Print "Factorial of " Num " is: " FactorialOfNum;
 ENDIf
END

8) Write a function that computes whether a number is prime or not.
PROGRAM CheckPrime:
 READ Num;
 Temp;
 Counter = 2;
  function CheckIfPrime(Num):
   Temp = Num /2;
   while (Counter <= Temp) 
    Do if (Num % Counter == 0)
     Print Num " is not a Prime Number."
    else
     Counter = Counter + 1;
   Print Num " is a Prime Number."
 CheckIfPrime(Num); //calling function while passing Number to it here to check if it is prime or not!
END

9) Write a program that checks if a triangle is scalene, equilateral or isosceles.
PROGRAM CheckTraingle:
 Read Side1;
 Read Side2;
 Read Side3;
 if (Side1 == Side2) AND (Side1 == Side3)
  Print "Triangle is Equilateral!";
 else if (Side1 == Side2) OR (Side1 == Side3) OR (Side2 == Side3)
  Print "Triangle is Isosceles!";
 else
  Print "Triangle is Scalene!";
 EndIf

10) Print Pattern:
*
**
***
****
*****

PROGRAM PatternLoops:
 Pattern = *;
 for (i = 1; i <= 5; i++)
  for (j = 1; j <= i; j++)

BONUS: Write a function that checks whether a number is a palindrome or not.
PROGRAM CheckPalindrome:
 Read Num;
 Reverse = 0;
 Temp = Num;
 LastDigit;
 function CheckIfPalindrome(Num):
  while ( Num > 0 ) // loop iterates till number becomes zero and comes out of the loop.
   LastDigit = Num % 10;
   Reverse = Reverse * 10 + LastDigit;
   Num = Num / 10; // to decrease the digits from the last everytime to make it 0.
